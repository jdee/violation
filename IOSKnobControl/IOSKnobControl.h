/**
 * A simple, reusable rotary control. You may provide custom knob images or use the default images, which may be customized
 * using a number of properties and methods. The control chooses an image based on state,
 * like the UIButton control. In any state but disabled, the knob control responds to a one-fingered rotation gesture and
 * animates rotation of the current image in response, programmatically reading out the current angular position of the knob
 * and generating a UIControlEventValueChanged each time the knob rotates.
 *
 * The knob control and all images must be square. Images will usually be circles or regular polygons, with a
 * transparent background or a solid one that matches the view behind it. However, the aspect
 * ratio must be 1:1. The effect of the animation is circular rotation. This only works if the control
 * is square. You can produce other effects, for example, by partially clipping a square control
 * or using an oblong background. But the control itself always has to be square. If an oblong frame is specified
 * for the control, the frame will be made square. The larger of the original sides will will be used for both the
 * width and height. The origin of the frame will be unchanged.
 *
 * The knob control requires ARC, and hence iOS 5.0 or later. It has not been tested below iOS 6.1.
