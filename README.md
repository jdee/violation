Violation
=========

Violation is a collection of utility software. For now, it's primarily a custom
gesture recognizer for iOS and a custom control that uses it. In the future, it may
expand to include other sorts of software, for mobile platforms and otherwise.

The word _violation_ is a loaded term in computing, referring to a runtime error or
the failure to observe the terms of a license. It's short and memorable, and happily
it does not conflict with other software companies or products.
